# cushendun
Training project to have a go at writing an android app.

The content is centered around data that may be useful to myself and my family while holidaying in the seaside village 
of Cushendun. I gather date on the weather, tides/sea conditions and data on moon phases as planets currently visible.

Implemented in Java and uses a mixture of free APIs that return JSON and some ugly screen scraping to get the data.
